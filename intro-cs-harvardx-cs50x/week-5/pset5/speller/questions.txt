3.  before and after are passed by reference (instead of by value), because passing large structs by value is slow. Passing or returning structs by
    value, places copies of those values on the stack, causing stack overflow.
4.  fgetc gets an unsigned char from fp and finds the next position indicator in fp until the EOF is reached. Each character is put through a conditional statement that checks if the character
    is an alphabetical character or an apostrophe that is not at index 0 of the word, the character is added to the word array. If not the character is numerical, the word is ignored and
    skiped ahead to the. Else if a space or punctuation is found then the conditional statement ends by adding \0 to the end of the word.
5.  fgetc and fscanf, both read input from a stream. However fscanf() could cause problems, because words in files may not always end with a space or line return.
6.  The value of const will not change later in the program it will keep the value assigned to it.
